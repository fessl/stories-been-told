                <h2>Sapiens</h2>
                <p>Reading history helps us put things into perspective, and <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0771038518" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sapiens</a></em> by Yuval Noah Harari offers plenty of opportunities to do so. Entertaining, easy to read and opinionated, this book is worth anyone’s time. “Cultures are constantly trying to reconcile contradictions, and this process fuels change.” – December 2024</p>

                <p>In the first fifty pages, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Two-Solitudes-Hugh-MacLennan/dp/0773524924" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Two Solitudes</a></em> by Hugh MacLennan explains the foundational clash of English and French cultures in Canada better than any history book. And that’s on top of offering an engaging story of its own. “Even if the two race-legends were like oil and alcohol in the same bottle, the bottle had not been broken yet.” – December 2024</p>

                <h2>The Molecule of More</h2>
                <p>Few molecules influence our behaviour more than dopamine. In <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Molecule-More-Chemical-Creativity_and-Determine/dp/1948836580" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Molecule of More</a></em>, Daniel Lieberman explains how the dopamine circuit works and what we can do to avoid tilting the balance into the red. Plenty of practical and insightful examples. “From dopamine’s point of view, having things is uninteresting. It’s only getting things that matters.” – August 2024</p>

                <p>While Saramago’s slow narrative, run-on sentences, lack of punctuation, and no character names should make his books difficult to understand, he manages to do the opposite, producing authentic page-turners. <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Double-Novel-Jose-Saramago/dp/0156032589" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Double</a></em> is no different. “Such is our need to shower blame on some distant entity when it is we who lack the courage to face up to what is there before us.” – August 2024</p>

                <h2>Four Thousand Weeks</h2>
                <p>As a mortality reminder, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Four-Thousand-Weeks-Management-Mortals/dp/0735232466" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Four Thousand Weeks</a></em> by Oliver Burkeman takes a philosophical approach to getting things done, asking, “Why would you do this in the first place?” Cramming extra tasks into your to-do list makes you more anxious than productive. “Meaningful productivity comes not from hurrying things up but from letting them take the time they take.” – April 2024</p>

                <h2>Getting Real</h2>
                <p>The main idea behind <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Getting-Real-Smarter-Successful-Application/dp/0578012812" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Getting Real</a></em> by Jason Fried and DHH is that creating plans, strategies, presentations, reports, and high-fidelity mockups isn’t work. Work is dealing with something real — copy, code, customers, and other variables that bring the project to the market. “Scope down. It’s better to make half a product than a half-assed product.” – December 2023</p>

And don’t those questions apply to everything? “It wasn’t him and at the same time it was, like a ghost from a separate timeline.” – December 2023</p>

It’s a book of depth, puzzles and hidden references, but also of playfulness, humour and disregard for the rules. Skip the annotated version but keep a dictionary nearby. And persevere. “When one reads these strange pages of one long gone one feels that one is at one with one who once.” – November 2023</p>

And <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Sourdough-Bonus-Story-Suitcase-Clone/dp/1250869692" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sourdough</a></em> is no exception.

It’s a light and straightforward story. “A thing I believe about people my age: we are the children of Hogwarts, we just want to be sorted.” – February 2023</p>

                <p>Reading Becker is not easy and actually took me three tries. But there are some profound nuggets of understanding of heroism, depression and death in his wall of academicism. In <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Denial-Death-Ernest-Becker/dp/0684832402" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Denial of Death</a></em>, Becker dares you to experience life without prejudice. “The question of human life: on what level of illusion does one live?” – July 2021</p>

                <h2>Stories of Your Life and Others</h2>
                <p>For years I was recommended Ted Chiang as a genius of short-form sci-fi writing. When I finally picked up <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Stories-Your-Life-Others-Chiang/dp/1101972122" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stories of Your Life and Others</a></em>, I could see why. His erudition leads him from the most improbable hypotheses to fully fledged philosophical riddles. “What made it possible for me to exercise freedom of choice also made it impossible for me to know the future.” – March 2020</p>

                <h2>Understanding Comics</h2>
                <p>Out of all the media, comics seem to be the most misunderstood, often written off as a step before actual art and literature. Scott McCloud set out to change that with <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Understanding-Comics-Scott-McCloud/dp/0613027825" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Understanding Comics</a></em>, an insightful inquiry into how comics have developed as an art form. “In a realistic drawing you see others, in a cartoon you see yourself.” – February 2020</p>

                <h2>The Shape of Design</h2>
                <p>Frank Chimero talks about design as a play between the creator, the creation and the audience. His <em><a href="https://buyolympia.com/Item/frank-chimero-the-shape-of-design-paperback" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Shape of Design</a></em> is a definite inquiry into the why of creativity. “If an artist or designer understands the objective, he can move in the right direction, even if there are missteps along the way. But if those objectives are left unaddressed, he may find himself chasing his own tail.” – January 2018</p>

In his masterpiece, <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Invisible-Cities-Harvest-Hbj-Book/dp/B00SQCAXD8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Invisible Cities</a></em>, he writes “divide cities into those that through the years and the changes continue to give their form to desires, and those in which desires either erase the city or are erased by it.” – January 2017</p>

                <h2>Homage to Catalonia</h2>
                <p>Besides <em>1984</em> and <em>Animal Farm</em>, George Orwell wrote a wonderfully sentimental account of the Spanish Civil War, something I knew little about until I got a copy of <em><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Homage-Catalonia-George-Orwell/dp/1849025975" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Homage to Catalonia</a></em>.

Exploring how advertising intrudes on our ability to focus, leading to the loss of public space, he suggest that “just as clean air makes respiration possible, silence … is what makes it possible to think.” Unplug. – November 2016</p>

                <h2>Later Short Stories</h2>
                <p>Anton Chekhov is renown for his ability to bring light to the most nuanced aspects of personal relationships. And his <em><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0679603166" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Later Short Stories</a></em> from the 1888–1903 period go even deeper and explore even further, observing what it is that makes us human. “…Before I loved, I myself also perfectly knew what love is.” – November 2015</p>

                <h2>Anything You Want</h2>
                <p>“No ‘yes.’ Either ‘hell yeah!’ or ‘no’” is one of many quotes from <em><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00SI0B5FS" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Anything You Want</a></em>that I wrote down. It’s a heuristic for evaluating commitments, intended to free up your time. The moment you pick this manifesto up, you realize that Derek Sivers lives by unique rules. And throughout the book he is making it clear — you don’t have to live the life you don’t want to live. – October 2015</p>

                <h2>Yoga Body</h2>
                <p>There’s a widespread perception that yoga is an ancient tradition, that asanas are distilled through thousands of years of Indian wisdom. Mark Singleton, relying on written accounts of various yoga teachers and travellers in his <em><a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/0195395344" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Yoga Body</a></em> discovers how in fact modern yoga was influenced, among other things, by European gymnastics and the emergence of bodybuilding. – August 2015</p>

                <p>So much written about WWII, yet it’s rare to find a true perspective of a soldier. Most of the ones who fought were killed; those who survived not willing to recall. Nikulin was the latter, although he did eventually write down what he went through to “get rid of oppressive thoughts.” After 25 years of gathering dust, <em><a href="http://www.imwerden.info/belousenko/books/nikulin/nikulin_vojna.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Recollections of the War</a></em> was published to share his nightmares. – July 2015</p>

                <p>Mike Monteiro, a co-founder of Mule Design, definitely reads like a fresh voice in the tech industry. His on-point wit and unconventional views in <em><a href="http://abookapart.com/products/design-is-a-job" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Design Is a Job</a></em> are worth writing down. “I’m not trying to make a connection between art and design.
